	<p>A javascript logger suitable for real life applications that extracts log messaging from inside the code base into its own files. This is a more secure way to log so you can launch your application without the log messaging quickly and easily. Js Log makes it much more easy to lay out your logs in a BDD format, while giving you the control to turn them on and off with a single variable.
